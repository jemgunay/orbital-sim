# Orbital Sim
A dinky C++ physics simulation (using the SFML library) of a rocket and hundreds of textured planets flying through space and colliding with each other. Rocket texture created in Adobe Illustrator.

## Usage
Run Debug/OrbitalSimV2.exe to launch. 'WASD' or arrow keys to move rocket, 'R' and 'F' keys to zoom in and out.

Requires SFML-2.3.1 to compile.
