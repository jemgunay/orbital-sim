# Orbital Sim
A dinky C++ physics simulation (using the SFML library) of a rocket and hundreds of textured planets flying through space, orbiting and colliding with each other. Rocket texture created in Adobe Illustrator.

Low resolution screenshots can be found in '/previews'.

## Usage
Run '/Debug/OrbitalSimV2.exe' to launch.
'WASD' or arrow keys to move the rocket, 'R' and 'F' keys to zoom in and out.

Requires SFML-2.3.1 to compile.
